üß≠ Decentralized Karma System (Clarity Smart Contract)

üìò Overview

The Decentralized Karma System is a Clarity smart contract that allows anyone to assign and track karma points for blockchain wallets based on their good deeds or community contributions.
It maintains transparent, tamper-proof records of karma scores and histories, enabling fair reputation tracking across a decentralized ecosystem.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Features
ü™ô Karma Scoring

Each wallet has a unique karma score, stored on-chain.

Users can add karma to themselves or to others for positive actions.

Overflow checks ensure scores remain within safe limits.

üìú Transaction History

Every karma addition is logged in the karma-history map with:

recipient (who received karma)

giver (who gave it)

amount (karma value)

block-number (when it happened)

This allows full transparency of all karma transactions.

üë• Participation Tracking

Tracks the total number of participants with non-zero karma.

Automatically increments when a wallet receives karma for the first time.

üß© Batch Operations

Allows batch karma assignments to up to 10 recipients in one transaction.

Validates that all provided amounts are positive and lists match in length.

üíé Good Deeds Awarding

Specialized function award-good-deed for assigning karma with a descriptive reason (deed-type string).

Limits individual awards to a maximum of 100 karma per transaction.

Useful for gamified or community-based reward systems.

üîí Safety & Validation

Prevents:

Adding zero karma amounts

Overflow errors

Invalid list lengths during batch processing

Constants are used for error codes, ensuring consistent error handling.

üöÄ Initialization

Upon deployment, the contract owner (deployer) automatically:

Receives 1 karma point

Becomes the first participant in the system

(map-set karma-scores CONTRACT-OWNER u1)
(var-set total-participants u1)

;; Give 10 karma points to another user
(contract-call? .karma add-karma 'SP3XK6K... u10)

;; Give yourself 5 karma points
(contract-call? .karma add-my-karma u5)

;; Reward someone for "helping the community"
(contract-call? .karma award-good-deed 'SP3A4ZQ... u15 "helping the community")
